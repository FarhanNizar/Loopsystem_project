# CFD02 - Loop Project

## Introduction
The Loop Project is the Capston project assignment of the course of Certified Fabric Developer - batch 02 (CFD02), the course conducted by "The BlockchainHub and University of York", the Loop Project was assigned to four students and this the group work of following students:  
#### 1. HJalmar
#### 2. Jane
#### 3. Farhan Nizar
#### 4. Mohammed Huda

## Introduction to Loop
Loop is a technology-driven freight forwarder. Loop eliminates the jargon associated with high volume shipping and creates a collaborative logistics environment. The platform provides an arena for real time tracking and visibility for shipments across the entire supply chain.

## Loop in Hyperledger Fabric 
Loop wants to adopt decentralized technologies in private network, Hyperledger Fabric provides the decentralized network and distributed ledger in private network, Loop is looking forward to integrate their business functionalities with Hyperledger Fabric.

## Loop Business Process
As Loop provides shipping solutions to handle high volume shipping and creates a collaborative logistics environemnt, following Actors are involved in Loop business process:
